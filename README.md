# Hospital-Bed-Optimization
This project applies Operations Research techniques to solve a critical resource allocation problem in a 136-bed hospital. Facing fluctuating patient demand and frequent capacity shortages, a Linear Programming (LP) model was developed to optimize weekly bed allocation across four departments: ICU, Emergency, Surgery, and General Medicine.
